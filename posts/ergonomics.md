# Vim/Ergonomics

Ergonomics isn't taken seriously enough.
Here's a running list of things I do to improve my ergonomics.

## Neovim

This is the biggest one which drastically decreases the amount of mouse usage needed during programming.
You can see my neovim config [here](https://github.com/RohanAdwankar/nvim)

## Vimium

On a similar note, I use [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium) for browsing the web.
This enables almost almost all browsing to be done with the keyboard.

## Vinav

There is a small subset of cases where I need to use the mouse because vimium doesnt work.
For those cases I use [Vinav](https://github.com/RohanAdwankar/vinav) which enables controlling the mouse with vim keybindings.

## Split Keyboard

Ideally I will eventually get an ergonomic keyboard which is split so that the wrists dont have to bend inwards but for now I have a sort of strange setup.
I use an external keyboard and my laptop keyboard together while viewing on an extnernal monitor.
This allows me to have hands apart with one keyboard for each hand.
